# HMXBwebcat5
The online Catalogue of Galactic High-Mass X-ray Binaries, 5th Edition

This website offers a quick way to browse the catalogue of HMXBs as published in [ref].
We also regularly update the data available and publish downloadable versions based on new information available on the current binaires / new discoveries.

## Column description

### Main ID
The most commonly used and/or historical identifier of the source.

### [Hidden] Simbad IDs
Complete list of all identifiers available for the source in the Simbad database.

### Spectral type
Spectral type of the companion star in the binary.

### Class
Subtype of HMXB according to the spectral type.
sg: supergiant HMXB
Be: Be HMXB
SFXT: Super Fast X-ray Transient
sgB[e]: supergiant with forbidden emission lines
WR: Wolf-Rayet

### Right ascension, Declination, Error radius
Sky coordinates from the most accurate counterpart we found. Right ascension and Declination are given in degrees. The 90\% positional error radius is given in milli-arcsecond (mas).

### Distance
Distance to the source as published in Bailer-Jones (2021).
Note: this is only available to HMXBs with a Gaia counterpart.


### Mx, Mo
Masses of the compact object (Mx) and of the companion star (Mo), given in Solar Mass.


### Period
Orbital period of the binary system, given in days.


### Super orbital period
Super orbital period detected in the binary, given in days.


### Eccentricity
Eccentricity of the orbital solution for the binary.


### Spin period
Spin (or pulse) period detected in the binary, given in seconds.


### Radial velocity
Systemic radial velocity of the binary (unaffected by orbital motion), given in km/s.


### Variable ?
Flag for variability taking into account results from the INTEGRAL, 4XMM DR11, Chandra and Swift 2SXPS catalogues.
